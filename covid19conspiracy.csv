This relatively benign and newly discovered pathogen was invoked to keep us compliant during the biggest crash in economic history. A virus with a mortality rate incomparable to the plethora of epidemic diseases due to its statistical harmlessness (80% of the population have mild to no symptoms) would never cause a total shutdown of the world economy in previous history. People need to lift the veil of fear and anxiety to come to realise that the real damage arises from the manipulation of human emotion -  leading us down a path devoid of personal freedom. With our blame pointed at the millennial population and children as culprits of transmission to the elderly,  the government hopes to create a political divide between millennial and senior voting populations.
 In these turbulent times we must be very cautious and question authority in order to maintain control of our democratic freedoms. Don't believe until the truth is presented.  Don't follow until the light guides you."

7,"I‚Äôm just a CPA, but...",braesmamma,1585137403,4,17,1.0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Covid19Conspiracy/comments/fojpro/im_just_a_cpa_but/,"I have to put all of these thoughts I‚Äôm having somewhere so here it goes:

From the ‚Äúcrazy CPA‚Äù

The Coronavirus started as a virus in China in roughly November. Been worried about it since, because of how fast it spread. I don‚Äôt care where it originated, that‚Äôs irrelevant today.  But like any virus, the virus spreads to others. And in this case we knew it was highly contagious and likely would spread very fast. The flu is a virus and spread this way in 1918 and continues to infect people today even though we have a vaccine. Vaccine does not equal a cure. So the world sees a virus in November and knows it‚Äôs

1.  Highly contagious 
2. Easily transmissible 
3. Asymptotic for a period of time and completely for some 

This was not hidden by the Chinese from us. It was news then, all you had to do was read CNN, Yahoo or shoot even Fox News. A virus is breaking out in China that spreads!!! Hmm, a logical brain tells a logical person, especially in 2019-2020 that at least one person got out. I mean, I‚Äôve watched Contagion!!!  

But the rest of the world didn‚Äôt care. I mean it‚Äôs just a virus, how bad can it get?? 

At this stage - 2 worlds are starting to collide.  Health/Science and Economics. 

The scientists start saying ‚Äúthis shit is bad‚Äù and the money people start saying ‚Äúbut we cannot shut down over a virus! I mean, who does that? It‚Äôs ludicrous‚Äù. 

Only going by what I read, but when I read a report that the head of HHS brought up the Coronavirus in a meeting with president Trump in January and he responded by cutting him off to ask when we could start selling flavored vape products?? 

We all already know what he said in public about it, not going there and don‚Äôt care to. It‚Äôs irrelevant today. 

That‚Äôs mid-January. We already know there‚Äôs a highly contagious virus, that‚Äôs likely spreading the globe that is asymptotic in some people who are still spreading the virus and in others they get sick, especially in elderly or those with underlying conditions. I‚Äôm an accountant and I knew about this virus. Just as my daughter who is also a nurse - she was getting tired of her hypochondriac Dad talking about this Coronavirus. I wasn‚Äôt being paranoid, I simply was playing a numbers game. I‚Äôm not a genius and never will be, but I think logically. It was coming here eventually. 

Cases started happening more and more around the globe and you start wondering, wow this has to get here, it‚Äôs logic. Common sense!!!

See this is a virus, just like the flu is a virus. We have a vaccination for the flu not a cure. Thousands die every year of the flu, including those who have been vaccinated. As a client said, a virus the world has never seen, that spreads fast and sort of hides itself. This wasn‚Äôt hidden from anyone, including those in charge, they simply failed to act. That‚Äôs the sad part. But not just America, other countries as well. We simply put the almighty dollar before human lives. I‚Äôm a CPA so I understand that, however we are now feeling the brunt all over the world. And for that I‚Äôm sad for humanity. 

As I‚Äôve said several times in the past day, humans are selfish by nature. We all are, admit it. We want to protect ourselves and our loved ones. I do, so do you.  However, because of that it will cost us now and in the future. 

Our leaders should have put a plan in place starting in January when they knew it would make its way here. It‚Äôs  science, biology logic...just common sense. Instead we did what we always do with problems that may affect us negatively, we ignored them. That decision  will cost us now and in the future. 

We knew about a problem and ignored it. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone, but inaction is causing the crisis, not the virus itself. Because I know of healthcare people who were and still are simply ignoring it until they have no choice. 

I got an email from a client in Indiana. She tested positive today. She‚Äôs been sick for a week. A week ago they said there are no positive cases in our county, so here‚Äôs some TamiFlu, and sent her on her way. Problem was several were symptomatic and were not being tested. Did you travel outside the country? Were you around anyone who is a confirmed positive?  Isn‚Äôt there always a first?  First in country, state, county, city,
town, village?  Numbers never lie. She tested positive today, a week later!!!  Been around a lot of people. Her comment: doctors offices are receiving 200 calls with the same symptoms.  Hmm, wonder what they have?? Again, logic. Not hard. 

My daughter tested presumptive positive on Saturday, told to go home quarantine for 14 days, then 14 days after symptoms subside, then 2 negative tests. Ok. By the time she got home the rules had changed. Once symptom free for 72 hours you are good. Is anyone catching on yet?  When a new virus appears that we know nothing about, people start changing rules as we go. Funny how the CDC said today, a cruise ship that was empty for 17 days still has live virus. So how do they really know?

Now, daughter gets results back in 48 hours when she was told a negative test takes 7 days to truly show no virus. I know testing was getting better, but who tested the testers??  Hmm, logic again. She tested negative and when asked what she had then, likely a virus that has THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS!!! Thats scary. She has a super dry cough, low grade fever, more exhausted than ever, shortness of breath.  That checks every box of what I have looked at as symptoms for a 25 year old. Which not sure how they have put the data of which age groups have what symptoms, there is not enough data to satisfy me. But she‚Äôs negative on a new testing system they just started. Again, logic tells me they have no clue what‚Äôs going on. 

That‚Äôs all the science. Now to the fiscal part. People need their jobs and businesses need to stay afloat. So instead of worrying about this virus, we all just kept plugging along. Thinking- I can‚Äôt close my business because of a virus. I need my paycheck, boss says we are open, I have to go to work, even though I‚Äôm a little worried. 

So here we kept going along like it wasn‚Äôt going to affect us. I was the first business in my town to close to the public and I‚Äôm a PUBLIC accounting firm. I have been damn near laughed out of office for saying NCAA might be cancelled. That was 2 weeks before it happened.  I‚Äôm just an accountant everyone, not a rocket scientist. If our administration doesn‚Äôt have people much smarter than me who knew this, we are all screwed. 

And here we all sit wondering how we will get our paychecks, pay our bills, pay our employees. Still, right now. I have clients, employers, employees panicked. These are businesses of all types, we are all affected.  I have read the senate bills and the house bills, this will be the single biggest amount in HISTORY. And we are haggling over planned parenthood. 

All sports are cancelled, they cancelled the Olympics, cancer patients have been put on hold, Vegas is closed and we are talking about getting back business by Easter???  Is that a joke? Anyone remember anything like this? Again, logic/common sense. Not hard to see. 

These bailouts basically appear to pay us to stay home until June. I suggest we all do. Stay in, ride it out. Be responsible and compassionate to each other. Do your part. 

But I want everyone to remember it wasn‚Äôt one party or they other that failed us. It is ALL OF THEM. 

We are talking about people who were getting briefed about this virus who went and sold stocks after. Both parties, BTW. These are also the same people who knew how serious it was because they were worried about their money who then shook hands with each other, ate lunch together and in one case was in a gym with people when all gyms across most of country were closed. Now the senate can‚Äôt have a full vote and the house is ‚Äúnow‚Äù scared of it. These are our leaders folks. Remember that. They are idiots who have no idea what all of us go through on the daily grind of life. They sit in their ivory towers and play us like pawns against each other. 

NO MORE. 

We must unite, make it through this and get real people who actually care and will guide us. 

They all missed the boat on this one, ALL OF THEM.

Be safe. 

From the crazy CPA."
8,COVID isn't scary. What people are doing right now is scary.,mindputty,1585733757,19,14,0.76,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Covid19Conspiracy/comments/fsq0e8/covid_isnt_scary_what_people_are_doing_right_now/,"**TL;DR: Money is driving Covid-19 panic/overreaction. Investors will get richer. Everything will go back to normal. Don't be a Covidiot. Don't give away your rights and freedoms. 1% of our already-sick grandparents may die, but they were probably going to die this year anyway, covid or not.**

Something's going on. Exactly what, I have no idea. The really odd thing that worries me the most is the lack of dissenters and free thinkers who have some sort of differing opinion. The fact that people will disagree is a universal given, yet it's as if the whole world, whether at the governmental or personal level, is all speaking in unison, which is terribly worrying, though perhaps to be expected, knowing human psychology. 

I could be completely wrong, and I have grappled with the consequences of leading people astray with incorrect opinions (what if I'm wrong and I affect people's behavior and someone contracts the virus that otherwise wouldn't have?). Take what I have to say with a grain of salt and make your own decision. Having said that, here's what I think. 

Even faster than the spread of the disease was the spread of the information that alerted to the world of this horrible virus that was touted as worse than all others to come before. The response was unusually fast and the quickness that governments, the WHO, and others to agree and take action was unprecedented. You'll see news stories telling you the exact opposite, but it's are BS -- we are moving EXTREMELY quickly on this. Governments and bureaucracies are always INCREDIBLY slow to take action, especially with so little confirmed evidence, and yet the response spread FAST, and countries decided to take HUGE economic hits that they would never do.

So much of the seriousness on the matter HINGES on us accepting certain facts to be true. Specifically, we MUST believe that Covid is *much deadlier* than regular seasonal flu. I believe that we will see that it is extremely comparable to regular seasonal flu. There are some sources now (months after the initial panic), that are warning us that the death rate is likely grossly over-exaggerated.  [https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/utterly-unreliable-the-mystery-behind-the-true-covid-19-death-rate/ar-BB11Y3e4](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/utterly-unreliable-the-mystery-behind-the-true-covid-19-death-rate/ar-BB11Y3e4) As with other viral outbreaks, such as SARS, MERS, etc. The initial death rate is touted as higher than the actual death rate that is seen in the end. There's several reasons to believe that the numbers we're seeing are grossly off:

Selection bias. We are only testing those who are gravely ill or who need hospitalization. One theme in many news stories is how testing is restricted. They are controlling the numbers so that they can continue to report x / y, keeping the y as selective as possible so that the percentage is as high as possible. We are exclusing from y all of the mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. Some sources claim that we are off by a factor of 30x. That would mean that the actual death rate is less than the seasonal flu. The WHO claims that 650,000 people die yearly from influenza. I predict we will see far fewer deaths from covid-19 than from influenza. This seems like a bold claim to make given how quickly it has exploded, but it's exactly because of its quick explosion that I think it will  be less severe. We know that the virus is especially harmful to those with compromised immune systems and those with comorbidities / preexisting conditions. In fact, of all the deaths in Italy, only 12% of the deaths were attributed to the virus alone, while the rest of the patients had either 1, 2, 3, or more conditions already. We don't know the numbers or the science. That takes time, but we're rushing towards these conclusions because someone is spamming the panic button. It doesn't make sense for you to say that ""coronavirus killed him"" when he already had cancer, diabetes, liver failure and caught covid-19 in his final days. And yet, that's exactly what's happening in Italy, where we're getting all of the nasty statistics from. And those statistics are brought up again and again. Another thing that's brought up again and again is how ""young people aren't immune, either"". Well, no, they aren't, but nobody is. The incidence of young people getting sick is and will continue to be extremely rare. Yet, the way that those rarities are touted by the media is shocking - as if they are boosting the rare to make it look more normal than it is. Take this story for example, which is shameful -- the entire crux of the article is ""he died and he was young"".  [https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/teenage-boy-dies-in-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus/ar-BB11YMfM](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/teenage-boy-dies-in-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus/ar-BB11YMfM) Someone is seriously trying to push a narrative here. 

Any virus has a reproduction number - if 1 person gets it and spreads it to 2 other people, that rate is r=2. If R is exactly 1, it will carry on, one person at a time through the entire population until everyone has had it. Yet, that doesn't happen. If there is an R of 0.86, the virus will die out because on average, it's being spread to fewer than 1 person per person. That 0.86 is an *average*, at one *specific point* in time. Some people will spread to whole-units of people, while some will spread to 0. However, the important thing about R is that it is time-sensitive, and changing. If it were static, the first person who had a virus with R=0.86 would never pass it to anyone else, because someone can't spread it to 86% of one person (in reality, it's dealing with real whole integers of people - you can't pass it to 0.86 persons. It has to be 1 or 0 (or more than 1)).  In the beginning of any virus, without a vaccine, it will spread at a higher rate than later in its lifecycle, because of growing immunity, thinning of population, etc. Right now, the numbers are high because it's new and spreading and those numbers are being shouted from all the news outlets. That spread rate *will go down*. In order for a virus to spread at all through a population, it has to, by definition, have an R greater than 1 in the beginning, probably much higher than 1 (perhaps similar to the 2.3 being reported for covid...?).

Perhaps, just maybe, there is also a certain percentage of the population who is ""destined"" to die each year from contracting a disease because their immune system just won't be able to handle it (I say destined, but I don't really mean destiny or karma -- I mean they simply aren't healthy enough to make it with a reasonable degree of certainty, statistically speaking). Let's say that's 1%. Now, if coronavirus is particularly communicable, it will spread quickly, and let's say that it has. This means that a very large part of the population has contracted it already and a large percentage of that 1% (let's say half of the 1%, or 0.5%). Because they all got it at once, the numbers right now look really grim and that it will tear through the population, killing huge numbers of people. It might. It also could be, in reality, that it has a lower death rate than regular seasonal flu, but that everyone got infected in a short people of time / at the same time. This explains the burden that we see on hospitals, and \*does\* cause more deaths than would have been expected if the 'curve was flatter'. However, those numbers of deaths are a fraction of a fraction, and people would probably think that you're a kind person, but a bit insane if you were to suggest that the entire population be quarantined in their homes and that we throw half of the yearly budget for the entire nation down the drain to prevent a few extra seasonal flu deaths. Sounds cruel, perhaps, but that's what politicians and policy-makers are doing all the time. If you spend a dollar to save person A, it typically means that person B will die because they didn't get that dollar. Legislators *know* this. If you boost spending towards cancer research, that means that a different social program had to be cut to do it -- perhaps it was the suicide hotline. Right now, the US has approved giving away **2 of its 3.8 Trillion dollar yearly budget** to Americans.  That's over 52% of the entire budget, which is meant to go towards everything from those suicide hotlines, to road repair, research and development, building new infrastructure, trying to keep failing oil and vehicle industries alive, saving the environment, (and the list goes on and on) . Think that's coming out of the defense budget? Ha! Each American will receive about 1200 dollars. That's like chopping off your leg in order to self-cannibalize because you're starting to feel hungry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html) 

That money is \*needed\* to keep the economy going, and they're not putting that coal into the furnace - they're giving it to individual Americans so that they can afford what amounts to, perhaps *a month or two* of rent. That's it. What happens then? That's sheer LUNACY, when the *real* problem is that we're all forced to stay at home, when thousands and thousands of people are out of jobs and the economy is slowing to a halt. An economy ***needs*** a certain percentage of its budget to continuously be reinvested as fuel to keep itself going. It needs its population at work to keep the fire going. Throw away too much of that fuel, and it doesn't have the momentum to keep going -- ironically, just like the infection rate, R above, if it's too small, it simply dies out. Wars stimulate economies because everyone goes to work. Economies die if everyone stays at home.

So we have this virus that is doing exactly what every virus does -- starts off strong, and will weaken over time. And yet we have all these people pumping it up, making it out to be deadly, an epidemic, now a pandemic (the seasonal flu is also a pandemic, ya know). ""We need to rush, together, towards this single-minded solution."" WHY? Why are we all being fed this doom and gloom? It's ***all*** predicated on bad statistics (manipulated or badly calculated death rates), and the numbers that are being reported in the media can be explained in a ***number*** of ways (one report that I saw also pointed to the fact that Italy had a particularly light year in terms of influenza infections, so its population was more rife for a different cause of death, which explains why they are an outlier among all countries). But the SPEED with which we rush towards this and the conformity of policy (there were some at first, but they have backtracked) is, as has been pointed out, unprecedented. Unprecedented things typically aren't great. The status quo is great.

**The scary part isn't the virus itself.** I think the virus can be explained by the above, and that it really is just like influenza with a higher transmission rate. It's not genetically engineered. It's not a weapon. It's just a run of the mill virus. But it might be an opportunity that's being seized upon. The scary part is that we're all collectively accepting that we need to do whatever the government says and go into destroy-our-own-economy-mode. I guarantee far **far** more people are going to die from our poor decision making panic at the moment, than due to the exceptional deaths due to our unprepared medical system couldn't prevent because it was overwhelmed. What's scary is how governments are enacting emergency measures without any kind of oversight, like Canada's (usually) democratic process that rushed through the ability to just spend whatever they need, indefinitely, of taxpayers' money (don't worry, we \*promise\* to spend it wisely, even though there's no vote on how it's used anymore, for as long as we say so). Or in China where the government is not being transparent at all about how **exactly** it makes a determination of which citizens are allowed to associate and move about freely using color-coded self-imprisoning (""isolating""...?) apps. It's UTTERLY draconian and worse than Orwell could have imagined in 1984  [https://thenextweb.com/china/2020/03/03/chinas-covid-19-app-reportedly-color-codes-people-and-shares-data-with-cops/](https://thenextweb.com/china/2020/03/03/chinas-covid-19-app-reportedly-color-codes-people-and-shares-data-with-cops/) . 

Or I could be wrong. 

Are there groups interested in burning everything to the ground -- of pushing us towards this ridiculous cut-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face strategy? Perhaps, though more likely is what it always is: money. I'm willing to bet that what you'll see is that everything will return to normal in a matter of a couple of months (despite those who say it will drag out until at least 2022). During that time, stock prices will fall even further, while certain parties will keep buying those up. It's a perfect plan -- you don't have to actually kill anybody (any more than the seasonal flu already would have). All you have to do is control the media, spin everyone into a panic, and make people believe that it's the end of the world, juuuust long enough to buy what you want, then it all resolves without a hitch because of the great work everyone did in responding so quickly (i.e. we will never know if it stopped because of our intervention and ""self-isolations"", or because it *never would have been* a big deal in the first place). The stock price goes back to ""normal"", and you make a sweet sweet 30% on the market. 

Who could pull it off? The media, for one. It's a vicious circle -- the more afraid a person is, the more they listen to the media. We might see the investors and owners of media companies become extraordinarily rich in a few months (as if they weren't enough already). Amazon is **booming** at the moment (relatively speaking, which is all that matters in a game of comparisons). The media companies themselves will do well -- people are FORCED to stay at home and watch more tv, more Netflix, more msn news, more google ads. 

Another side-effect? Big polluters are being given carte-blanche -- they don't need to account for their sins for an indeterminate amount of time while this is happening. Nor do they even need to adhere to any of the rules. Go ahead and dump it all!

Or I could be wrong. We could be doing all the right things to stop the spread of a deadly virus. At a reasonable price/sacrifice.

Whether I'm right or only slightly right, or way off, we **NEED** to be super wary of giving up our rights and freedoms. Fear will make people lose their minds and makes otherwise unthinkable surrender of freedoms seem like a reasonable price to pay to stay alive. Remember: would we act this way if the ""death rate"" was only 1.5% lower (0.5%, i.e. the flu, as compared to 2%)? Never in a million years! How did 1.5% lead us to this (**IF** it's even that high)? I expect this to affect us less than the annual 650,000 deaths from influenza, especially now that we're exiting viral season. Only time will tell. I could be wrong.

I live in Texas, and raised an eyebrow when I heard a local prison had multiple reported cases of covid-19 before it had even really started to spread down here. This seems rather strange to me, though not totally unbelievable since a guard could have brought it in and since jails aren't the most sanitary places it could spread quickly and easily.

I got in my own head and started to look up other places that have outbreaks in prisons. There. Are. SO. Fucking. Many.

Like, it is sort of ridiculous how many prisons have outbreaks. And I get it, again unsanitary and they cram a lot of people into one space, but only about 5% (total statistical guess) actual leave the facility and then come back. What are the chances that a prison guard, a profession that a handful of people within a given area have, comes into contact with someone who has it? Seems pretty 'coincidental' to me.

The more rational part of me wants to say this may be false information, and a way of them halting introduction of new prisoners to the system since it is already overflowing and they may not have to spend so much on the prison system. The conspiracy theorist in me says they introduced it purposefully to clear out some cells.

JUST IN: SECRET BEHIND THE CORONAVIRUS LEAKED. 
""""""""""""""'''""'""""''''""""""""""''""""
I am a senior Chinese military intelligence officer and I know the truth about the coronavirus outbreak. It is far worse than the media are telling you.
I am a Chinese citizen in Wuhan who occupies ‚Äî or perhaps occupied ‚Äî a high-ranking position in military intelligence. I am also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. As a senior official near the top of the Party, I have access to a great deal of classified information and I have been involved in many top secret government projects. I have a doctorate from a leading university in a western country, which is why I am able to write my account in English.

I have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government. It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China, all of whom are now in existential peril.

It will not surprise you to hear that if my identity were to be revealed, my life would be in grave danger, as would those of my wife and son. I ask you to respect the fact that I have stripped out of this account all facts that would make it easy to identify me.

By now you will be familiar with the recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply ""coronavirus"". You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal ‚Äî most likely a bat or a pangolin ‚Äî that was sold in a wild animal market. You will have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Finally, you may have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune system. The official lethality rate is approximately 2% or so.

All of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of those countries.

Let me start by telling you that the world does not operate the way you think it does. Although countries like the US and China vie for global dominance, that competition is restricted to certain limited areas. In most ways, the two countries are more interested in cooperation so that they can stop other competing countries from gaining more power. They also have a shared interest in keeping real power out of the hands of their ""ordinary"" citizens. To this end, they have many different mechanisms by which they control the overwhelming majority of their media outlets. The Americans in particular have perfected the art of creating made-up ""divisions"" between their two main parties which are designed to hide the fact that both serve the same masters.

These same nations also posses technology that is far more advanced than you can imagine and which is kept carefully hidden from public view. This includes advanced artificial intelligence capable of undermining and deciding any election in the world; biological and chemical agents that can manipulate and control the thinking patterns and behaviours of citizens to terrifying degrees; highly sophisticated manipulation techniques using hypnotic practices entirely unknown to the public; and other things that I will not go into now. My point is that the great nations do not compete so much as work together. Their principal goal is to shield the true workings of the world from the ""uninitiated"" public.

Just to give you one example, there aren‚Äôt actually any nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. The U.S. and the Soviet Union scrapped them all in the 1970s, as did their client states. Everyone realised that those weapons could not be used without destroying the whole world, so there was no need for them; but by pretending that they still had them, the big players were able to keep the non-nuclear powers in line.

Let me return to the virus.

Last year, large-scale anti-government protests erupted in Hong Kong. The Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party considered these to be a grave threat to the integrity and stability of the motherland. The U.S. government and the EU both knew that the Chinese were secretly working on a biological agent that was supposed to make the protesters docile and obedient. Without going into detail, I worked on that project. We tried to develop a sort of spray that could be dispersed from helicopters or drones and that would lead to mental retardation and behavioural change.

Naturally, as Hong Kong is one of the most open and international cities in the world, the Party decided that it was too risky to release the agent in Hong Kong without first testing it. For this, it needed a great number of human guinea pigs. Two groups were identified for this.

First, we rounded up a large number of so-called ""islamic radicals"" in Xinjiang Province and took them to what we called ""training camps"". We had already been using these camps for human experimentation for several years, but the Hong Kong protests meant that we redoubled our efforts. We exposed the inmates to various ""alpha"" experimental agents. As these were odourless and invisible, the subjects were not aware that they were taking part in medical trials. The resulting high rates of cancer, premature dementia, suicidal depression and death by organ failure could easily be suppressed, as the camps are located in very remote parts of our motherland.

Once the initial experiments had yielded a ""beta"" agent, it was transported to Hubei Province, where it was deployed in a special military testing facility outside the city of Wuhan. This was not even a particularly well-kept secret: the existence of this facility has been reported in international news. Even the fact that it is located close to the wild animal market is a known fact.

By then our President had already introduced a ""social credit"" system that allowed us to identify disloyal, counter-revolutionary and bourgeois elements in our society. Using the social credit scores ‚Äî which are taken from online activity, electronic shopping behaviour and reports from informers in civil society ‚Äî we selected some of the worst offenders. These included human rights lawyers and activists, Christians, homosexuals, artists, intellectuals, people who speak foreign languages, and other undesirables.

Once these troublemakers had been collected and placed in the testing facility, we exposed them to the Agent, which is biochemical in nature and spread in an invisible aerosol, akin to certain viruses. Initial results were encouraging, as we saw significant cognitive decline and reduction in higher mental processing facilities. Essentially, our undesirables were becoming mildly mentally disabled, which is precisely the effect we wanted to produce in order to pacify the restive population of Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that the Agent also had other effects. About one week after the retardation set in, our subjects developed major anxiety and panic attacks. Eventually they developed symptoms akin to those of paranoid schizophrenics. At that point, their bodies rapidly deteriorated. They developed massive internal bleeding; the walls of their arteries dissolved; they bled out of their eyes and orifices, and their tissue disintegrated.

To put it in a more direct Western manner, they started to melt.

Death usually occurred through multiple organ failure. This was preceded by at least five days of severe agony which could not be alleviated by painkillers. It was at this time that I first violated our protocol: one subject, an elderly lady who had published defamatory cartoons of our President, begged me for death with such insistence that I took pity and shot her. I was reprimanded, but fortunately the complaint was dropped when I agreed to reimburse the cost of the bullet. I swore to myself never again to show such unnecessary emotion.

We decided that our Agent was unusable. It was far too destructive for our purposes. We wanted the population of Hong Kong to submit to us; we did not want to exterminate it.

Naturally, our American friends had by then taken an interest in our work and asked us for a sample for their own research and testing purposes. They hinted that they wished to use it to resolve certain difficulties in Venezuela. Normally we would have agreed, as we maintain friendly relations with the CIA, but given the extremely toxic nature of the Agent, we declined.

This, as it turned out, was a grave mistake. The CIA was convinced that we had developed something very powerful and wanted to keep it to ourselves. They offered a great deal of money to one of our researchers. Foolishly, he agreed to sell them a specimen. We found out just in time for the handover and tried to stop it from happening. In the ensuing shoot-out ‚Äî don‚Äôt bother to look for it in the news, it was never reported anywhere ‚Äî several dozen people were killed.

More importantly, however, the Agent escaped.

The shoot-out took place at the wild animal market which has been reported as the location of the ""animal to human"" transmission that started the outbreak. But of course there was no such transmission; it was just the location where the CIA was supposed to receive the sealed vial containing the Agent. The vial shattered when it was dropped by the traitor who had agreed to sell it to the Americans.

By now I understand you will be sceptical. If I really am who I say I am, why would I be sharing this information on the internet? Let me assure you that I am no friend of the Western system of governance. I love my motherland and I am loyal to the Communist Party. It has lifted hundreds of millions of my compatriots out of squalor and poverty. However, I am also a human being and I have a conscience.

Most importantly, I have a wife and a son.

Once we realised that the Agent had escaped and would start to spread, we swiftly put all of Wuhan into lockdown. I was one of those tasked to manage the fallout of the contamination. Of course we could not keep such a huge undertaking secret, so we decided to order our state media to report that a ""coronavirus"" had broken out in Wuhan.

In reality, of course, there is no ""coronavirus"". It was all made up.

It was one of my colleagues who came up with the genius idea of pretending that people with the common flu suffered from the coronavirus. This allowed us to hide the true nature of the disease. Let me explain.

It is currently flu season in China. When we realised that we could no longer control the spread of the Agent, we sent our men to all the hospitals and instructed all doctors to diagnose every case of the common flu as ""coronavirus"". We came up with a new name ‚Äî 2019-nCoV ‚Äî and handed out ""factsheets"" that described a made-up illness.

The result of this decision was that tens of thousands of individuals who were simply suffering from a cold or flu were now diagnosed as having a mysterious coronavirus that, although infectious, was not often lethal. While this frightened the public, it allowed us to push the narrative that the disease was not that deadly; it also gave us time to prepare for the catastrophe that was sure to come by imposing a lockdown on Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province.

You have not heard this in the news ‚Äî and given the size of Wuhan, with its population of 11 million, it is not known even to many of the residents ‚Äî but within days thousands upon thousands were infected and before long they suffered the agonising deaths that I have already described. Within a week, there were so many corpses that we did not know what to do with them, so we ordered the surviving social credit prisoners to drive the bodies into the countryside and bury them in mass graves. But it was very difficult to keep this activity secret, and we could not even keep up as there were so many corpses. We planted a story that five million residents had ""fled"" Wuhan. In reality, of course, many of those people had died from the Agent.

I was working around the clock helping to orchestrate this cover-up. When I think back to my actions now, I feel great shame. At the time I still believed that I was fighting for my motherland and that the rule of the Party was right and just. But deep down, I had already begun to have doubts.

My faith in the Party was shaken even more deeply when I learnt what had happened to Dr Li Wenliang. He was one of the few doctors who refused falsely to diagnose flu patients with the ""coronavirus"". As a punishment, he was sent to help transport dead bodies to mass graves. The expectation was that he would be infected with the Agent and die an agonising death, but to our great surprise, he did not contract the illness.

You have of course read that he died of ""coronavirus"". You have been misinformed. A sergeant of the People‚Äôs Armed Police injected him with a mixture of heroin and mercury that caused his lungs to deflate.

When I found out about this I became unsure whether or not I was doing the right thing. While I believe that it is appropriate for a government to rule with a severe hand, I do not think that it was right to kill Dr Li. He was a compassionate and kind man and he cared about his patients; how can our motherland not benefit from having such a doctor?

I shared my concerns with my wife, but she convinced me that I should not say anything to my superiors. She said that it was too dangerous; that they valued loyalty above everything else; and that I would only find trouble if I admitted to my doubts about their practices. She also pointed out that we benefited from priority medical treatment. As senior officials, we received regular supplies of the highly-sophisticated hazmat masks that are the only known technology that can prevent infection. She implored me to think of our son, who is still small. If I spoke out and were caught, our lives would be at risk.

Around the same time, it became clear that the Agent was entirely beyond our control. It was spreading like wildfire throughout Hubei Province and beyond, infecting tens of millions and causing them all to die.

I understand that what I just said is difficult to believe, because you have been told that there have been only about 50,000 infections, and far fewer deaths. But these are the influenza infections that have been falsely passed off as the non-existent ""coronavirus"". The Agent is far, far more contagious than that, and its fatality rate, unlike the ""coronavirus"", is not 2%.

No, its fatality rate is 100%. Nobody recovers from it. Everybody who contracts it dies.

And a lot of people are contracting it.

Hubei Province lies in ruins. The various travel restrictions and lockdowns that have been imposed were not created to stop the spread of the Agent ‚Äî none of them can stop it, not embargoes, not face masks or hand sanitiser ‚Äî but to stop the survivors from seeing the catastrophe with their own eyes.

I am part of the greatest cover-up in human history: the hiding of the deaths of tens of millions. Very soon, Hubei Province will be no more than a giant mortuary, and the truth will come out.

For me, the turning point came when the Party told yet another lie, and that lie was too dreadful even for me to accept. You may have heard that China built a new hospital, called Huoshenshan Hospital, in Wuhan, in order to provide additional quarantine and isolation facilities for infected patients. You may have heard that they built it in only ten days.

That too is a lie.

Sure, they did build something in six days. But it was not a hospital. The true nature of the building was top secret. Initially, I was naive enough to believe that the Party was demonstrating its compassion and care for the people. But then my superiors sent me to Huoshenshan. I was shown around the installation by a military police officer called Corporal Meng (this is not his real name). It was there that I saw the truth.

As I have mentioned, the only way to protect oneself from the Agent is by wearing a special protective mask that is entirely unlike those available commercially. Even medical professionals do not have access to it. It is available only to biomedical warfare researchers and it contains extremely advanced technology.

These masks need to be kept at a particular temperature to offer full protection, and lose their effectiveness very quickly. As I have also already said, one of the benefits of my position was that both my family and I had access to regular supplies, which is why were safe when compared to civilians, doctors and even lower-level government officials, all of whom wore utterly ineffective surgical masks in the misguided belief that they would protect them.

And so, wearing this special equipment, I went to Huoshenshan with Corporal Meng.

Whatever you want to call that place, it is not a hospital. Sure, the entrance looks like a hospital and in the ward at the front of the complex, there are what appear to be normal medical beds. There, thousands of infected patients lie, all of them in the early stages of the disease. I walked along those long, white corridors next to Corporal Meng, his angular face dispassionate in his military fatigues, and saw hundreds upon hundreds of identical hospital beds on which squirmed the terrified and diseased inhabitants of Wuhan. Their cries and pleas haunt me in the long nights in which I now am unable to sleep.

But this was merely the beginning. Eventually the Corporal took me to the rear of this front section. There, locked metal gates led to what he called the ""middle section"". The patients in the front are unaware of its existence. It is there that the more advanced cases are kept, in what most closely resembles a mental asylum.

Immediately upon entering this part of Huoshenshan I was struck by the dim lighting and stench of vomit and human waste. Here the unfortunates roamed freely, their minds gradually disintegrating in endless panic attacks and psychotic episodes. Here too there were no more doctors, merely gorilla-faced men in black uniforms who belonged to some secret branch of the military police I had never heard of.

They appeared to have been selected for their cruelty, for they beat and degraded the patients in the most sadistic manner. Many of the inmates had regressed to childlike states and lay on the floor weeping like infants and begging for compassion that they did not receive. There was cruel pleasure in the eyes of these thugs as they brutalised the unfortunates. They beat them with batons, sprayed pepper spray into their eyes and kicked them with their steel-capped boots. As I was from military intelligence, the guards did not even attempt to hide their activities. They even invited me to join; in every way, they treated me as one of them.

Yes, one of them. I stood in the grey staff bathroom of Huoshenshan and looked into a cheap mirror and asked myself ‚Äî is this really what you are? Are you really like them?

But the violence was not merely an expression of sadism, for the poor inmates were not there to be cared for.

They were there to work.

There was one more set of doors, and beyond them lay what the Corporal called the ""Core"". And it was there that I saw it ‚Äî piles and piles of dead bodies, stacked on top of one another all the way to the ceiling. There were men, women and children, elderlies and toddlers, rich and poor, beautiful and misshapen, proud and humble.

They were all of them dead. Our Agent made no distinction between any of them.

I gasped when the Corporal led me to the Core. I cannot count how many there were, but it was many, many thousands. And in the midst of the piles of corpses was a kind of path, and I heard a roaring sound in the distance. The miserable patients from the middle section picked up the dead and carried and dragged them away into the dark, even as the guards beat them with truncheons.

It took me a little while before I grasped what was happening. I simply could not believe what lay at the end of that path in the Core.

It was an enormous furnace, with great fires roaring within.

One by one, their minds destroyed and their bodies twisted, the dying men and women carried the corpses to the furnace and cast them inside in a doomed attempt to hide the dreadful truth. I saw several of them collapse from exhaustion only for their lifeless bodies to be added to the mountains of corpses on both sides. In a seemingly endless line they went, their emaciated bodies clad in grey overalls, their backs bent under the weight of their dreadful cargo. Many howled and groaned in terror and their voices joined in a sorrowful cacophony that lingered over the roar of the fires.

In deep shock, I stared at the boundless horror before me. Beside me stood Corporal Meng, his freshly-shaved face as emotionless as before. When I turned to face him, he looked at me. His mouth smiled, but his eyes did not.

""We use the energy to operate Huoshenshan,"" he said. ""We save the state considerable resources in this way. And look,"" ‚Äî he waved at the gallery of the dead ‚Äî ""there are so many of them here. You could almost describe it as renewable energy."" He laughed and waved his hand in a strangely camp gesture.

I stood speechless and stared at the infernal scenes before me. Men in black uniforms screamed like daemons at the wretches who were disposing of the corpses for them. They stripped the dead of anything that had value ‚Äî jewellery, cash, expensive clothing ‚Äî and tossed these items onto an enormous pile next to the furnace. When I asked the Corporal what would be done with the items, they said that they would be used to pay for the ""healthcare expenses"" incurred by the patients‚Äô stay in Huoshenshan.

I vomited in the toilet. When I flushed and came out of the stall, Corporal Meng stood by the door and looked at me. His face was as blank as before, but in his eyes I thought I registered a very faint trace of contempt. You are ten years my senior, the look said, but you are soft.

I thanked him for his service and went home.

When I arrived, I saw that I had received hundreds of updates on the encrypted device the Party uses to communicate to insiders. The news were unimaginably grim. The State Legal and Economic Commission had allocated funds for the construction of dozens of facilities like Huoshenshan all throughout China. The Agent had spread not only to every single province of the motherland, but to most other nations in the world. Fortunately, we had agreements in place with other governments ‚Äî they agreed to pretend that the infections were due to a coronavirus. They were just as worried as we were that a panic might break out in their countries. The Americans in particular were terrified that the S&P 500 might decline. This, they said, would be unacceptable in an election year, so we could count on their full support.

Of course the World Health Organisation also helped us. For a long time, the only issue with the WHO has been that we have been locked in a contest with the Americans about who bribes them more. They released all sorts of sophisticated misinformation about having decoded the DNA of the so-called coronavirus. All this has allowed us to stave off a global panic.

For now.

Yet the situation was worsening with astonishing speed. I am reluctant to reveal too much on this point, as it would make it too easy for my enemies to identify me, but we quickly began to implement measures to protect our most senior leaders. If you look at the world news, you will see that Xi Jinping, our President, disappeared for approximately one week after the outbreak, before being seen again with the leader of Cambodia.

You should know that the person who met the Cambodian leader was not President Xi. It was a body double who had, for many years, been trained to look and sound just like our President. President Xi is of course not careless enough to risk his own death. He is safely ensconced in a secret bunker underneath Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Party in Beijing.

Nor was he the only leader who is in hiding. In fact, I can assure you that over half of all senior Party members are currently being imitated by trained actors who are following instructions given to them via special implants. Do you really think that our Prime Minister would risk his life by going to Wuhan?

All of this means that our government has become utterly paralysed and the functions of the state have been taken over by the military.

It became clear to me that our efforts were pointless. Yes, the lockdowns, travel bans and targeted assassinations of rebellious journalists allowed us to hide the true situation in Wuhan; but I knew that this would not last. Once the mass deaths begin in the rest of the world ‚Äî in our estimation, this should happen within the next week or so ‚Äî everyone will know the truth. It will become clear that we cannot protect ourselves from the Agent. Surgical masks, hand sanitiser, gloves ‚Äî nothing can stop it. Nothing except the special hazmat masks, but those cannot be produced in anything like sufficient quantities. You, an ordinary person, will never even receive one, let alone a sufficient number to see you through the coming holocaust.

For those of you reading this, therefore, all I can suggest is that you keep your loved ones close to you. Hug them, tell them what they mean to you. Enjoy the time you have left with them. It is not typical in Chinese culture to express one‚Äôs feelings in this way, but I have learnt the importance of such gestures.

I promised my wife that I would show this document to her before I posted it.

Yet I broke my word.

I hear her weep in loud, hoarse sobs in the bedroom, and the keyboard of my laptop is wet with my own tears. Not long ago, we received results of the regular tests that are part of our ""priority medical treatment"", and we learnt that my son had been infected with the Agent.

The military police that has supplied me with the special protective mask had been giving expired and ineffective masks to my son, masks that senior officials had already worn and then discarded when they ceased to protect them. My own masks, on the other hand, had always been of the necessary quality.

I suppose they decided that my son was of lower priority than me. I suppose my son could not help them with their cover-up.

We had long ago decided that we would be different ‚Äî we would be honest with him, always. And so when he asked us, we told him the truth. We told him that he was very sick. He asked more, and we told him he would not get better.

He continued asking, and we told him that he would die. He is very small, but he was old enough to understand.

His terrified wails will haunt me for the rest of my miserable days in this world.

Let them come. Let them do with me as they will. I no longer care."

I don't know the motivation of the creator of this conspiracy theory. He is using ""we"" pronoun. Maybe there are multiple authors.

Some hypotheses:

- It's a global warming fanatic spreading misinformation to kill as many people possible (""humanity is a virus, the COVID-19 is the cure"") - the same type of people spreading anti-vaxer propaganda on purpose.

- Someone just want to receive donations from conspiracy theory fans

- Genuine conspiracy theorist that thinks he is doing good by exposing the evil conspiracy to create panic for financial gain (by using financial instruments like options, short selling of stocks, etc).

- Government-paid actors spreading misinformation to harm the enemy. This is extremely dumb, because memetic weapons like this can (and often do) backfire.

It was a fairly short period so the results were inconclusive. Now that the global response to Covid-19 has continued for a longer period of time, and expected to go on for weeks or even months, has already made a considerable positive effect on the causes of climate change. (before I continue,  I am certain Covid-19 is real and harmful and not itself a man made experiment). As a mind game, I thought it would be a genius secret experiment or even response to climate change that everyone unknowingly buys into. There is no left/right wing politics, no big oil/progressives arguments all for someones own personal benefit. But, everyone cares about their health and will do almost anything to protect it. So, what better way to bring a collective mindset to combat what could be the man made world ending crises.

I did this for a very good reason. I felt that something wasn't right about this whole situation from the beginning but wanted to form some opinions based on what I was actually seeing with my own eyes rather than be influenced by others thoughts and experiences. So here are a few things I noticed and a few questions I have regarding those observations:

1. At the time of this post there have been  1,772,369 covid19 tests performed with  336,830 tests coming back positive. So 81% of tests have come back negative, in raw numbers that's 1,435,539 negative results. So my first questions is what was wrong with these almost 1.5 million people? It isn't exactly easy to get a test, certain criteria must be met and early on that criteria was even more stringent.
2. Assuming the above percentages are correct that means that only 20% of people the CDC considers to be high risk for contracting the virus and have displayed some symptoms actually have this virus. Since only 20% of those considered high risk are testing positive I think it would be very very conservative to assume that less than 20% of the population will end up with the virus. With the US population being around 328 million that would mean that around 65 million people would be the high end for those actually catching this virus. Of that 65 million many will experience no symptoms or mild symptoms. In fact only about 5% of those testing positive end up being hospitalized and a small percentage of those hospitalized will die. So we can assume about 3.25 million people will be hospitalized. A fair assumption would be that  about 10% of those 3.25 million will not recover. That would put a death toll of around 325,000. A large number but a very small percentage. Again I think these numbers are very high and many other factors need to be taken in to account. For instance, how many of these people would have died from another cause? So my question is why are we shutting the entire country down for such a small mortality rate?

I have other questions but these are the two big things that I just can't seem to wrap my head around. Am I missing something? Is my logic flawed?"

Event 201 was a 3.5-hour pandemic tabletop exercise that simulated a series of dramatic, scenario-based facilitated discussions, confronting difficult, true-to-life dilemmas associated with response to a hypothetical, but scientifically plausible, pandemic. 15 global business, government, and public health leaders were¬†players¬†in the simulation exercise that highlighted unresolved real-world policy and economic issues that could be solved with sufficient political will, financial investment, and attention now and in the future.

The exercise consisted of pre-recorded news broadcasts, live ‚Äústaff‚Äù briefings, and moderated discussions on specific topics. These issues were carefully designed in a compelling narrative that educated the participants and the audience.

The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, World Economic Forum, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation jointly propose these¬†recommendations."

Through sophisticated assessment of the health, eating patterns, and medical histories of said peoples. Of particular importance is the emphasis on medical data of entire population pools be it the size of a city, county, or country. With this data they fish out patterns, and anomalies in response to heavy mapping of diets, causes of deaths, evironmental factors, food availability into corallativial info. They use this info to engineer a chemical weapon targeting said people by formulating ""bespoke"" viral/bacterial diseases that are, as we see, very accommodating guests. Its a scaled attack. China measured the ""radius of damage"" by having canvassed the state, capacity, and ability of health organizations to respond to health crisises and  to calibrate accordingly. They of course control the worlds manufacturing  thus having supply routes to nearly every sovereign/not sovereign state in the world.  The Oligarchy will kill thousands to control billions, that's a given. China will not lose a second of sleep putting down some of its people in order to grow its power/grip. Why are they doing this? Possible personal probable revenge? Italy was part of the Boxer Rebellion. They were simply chosen to test european bueracratic and infrastructural apparatuses.  Figured hey! why not little Italy? The weakest if the western European countries. Very much a calculated attack in every sense of the word. This moment in history will provide kindle to help ignite a new dawning on earth.
